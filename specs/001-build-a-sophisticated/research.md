# Research & Feasibility Analysis

**Feature**: Veritas Inversa (Aletheia) Website  
**Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Phase**: 0 - Research

## Executive Summary

This research phase addresses the technical decisions and architecture choices for building the Veritas Inversa decentralized narrative market platform. All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the specification have been resolved through informed technical decisions.

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Real-time Update Frequency
**Decision**: 1-second polling intervals with WebSocket fallback  
**Rationale**: Balances responsiveness with server load for financial-grade experience  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Pure WebSocket (complex state management)
- 5-second polling (too slow for trading terminal feel)
- Server-sent events (limited browser support)

### 2. Authentication Method
**Decision**: Web3 wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect)  
**Rationale**: Required for on-chain interactions with $NARR tokens and NFTs  
**Alternatives considered**:
- OAuth (doesn't support Web3 transactions)
- Email/password (poor UX for crypto users)

### 3. Duplicate Detection Threshold
**Decision**: Cosine similarity > 0.95 for semantic duplicates  
**Rationale**: Prevents gaming while allowing legitimate variations  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Exact match only (too restrictive)
- 0.90 threshold (too many false positives)

### 4. Performance Targets
**Decision**: 
- Initial load: <2 seconds
- API response: <200ms p95
- Dashboard updates: 1 second intervals
**Rationale**: Matches expectations for financial trading platforms  
**Alternatives considered**: Stricter targets would require significant infrastructure investment

### 5. Scale Requirements
**Decision**: 1000 concurrent users initially  
**Rationale**: Realistic for specialized DeFi platform launch  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- 100 users (too limiting)
- 10,000 users (premature optimization)

### 6. Security Model
**Decision**: 
- Content Security Policy headers
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input sanitization for XSS prevention
- Smart contract audit before mainnet
**Rationale**: Standard Web3 security practices  
**Alternatives considered**: Web application firewall (adds complexity)

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Frontend Framework
**Choice**: Next.js 14 with React 18  
**Rationale**:
- Server-side rendering for SEO and performance
- Built-in API routes for backend
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Large ecosystem for Web3 components

### Blockchain Integration
**Choice**: Ethers.js v6  
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and modular
- Better TypeScript support than Web3.js
- Active maintenance and documentation

### Data Visualization
**Choice**: D3.js with React wrapper  
**Rationale**:
- Most powerful for custom financial charts
- Required for semantic landscape visualization
- Can achieve trading terminal aesthetic

### Real-time Updates
**Choice**: Socket.io with Redis pub/sub  
**Rationale**:
- Automatic fallback to polling
- Horizontal scaling support
- Battle-tested in production

### Semantic Embeddings
**Choice**: Sentence-transformers via Python microservice  
**Rationale**:
- Best quality embeddings
- Can be cached effectively
- Isolated from main application

## Architecture Patterns

### Microservices vs Monolith
**Decision**: Modular monolith initially  
**Rationale**: 
- Faster development
- Easier deployment
- Can extract services later if needed

### State Management
**Decision**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state  
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight compared to Redux
- Built-in caching and synchronization
- TypeScript-first design

### API Design
**Decision**: REST with OpenAPI specification  
**Rationale**:
- Better tooling than GraphQL for this use case
- Easier caching strategy
- Simpler authentication

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Hosting
**Recommendation**: Vercel for frontend, Railway for backend  
**Rationale**:
- Optimized for Next.js
- Easy scaling
- Good Web3 support

### Database
**Choice**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension  
**Rationale**:
- Time-series data for metrics
- JSONB for flexible NFT metadata
- Proven reliability

### Caching
**Choice**: Redis  
**Rationale**:
- Real-time pub/sub
- Session storage
- Query result caching

### IPFS Node
**Choice**: Infura IPFS gateway  
**Rationale**:
- Managed service reduces complexity
- Reliable uptime
- Good developer experience

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
1. **Semantic embedding performance**: Mitigated by caching and background processing
2. **Smart contract vulnerabilities**: Mitigated by audits and gradual rollout
3. **Real-time data accuracy**: Mitigated by event sourcing and reconciliation

### Scalability Risks
1. **Database bottlenecks**: Mitigated by read replicas and caching
2. **WebSocket connections**: Mitigated by connection pooling and load balancing
3. **IPFS latency**: Mitigated by pinning service and CDN

## Development Approach

### Phase 1 Priorities
1. Core data models and API contracts
2. Wallet connection and authentication
3. Basic marketplace dashboard
4. Narrative NFT creation flow

### Testing Strategy
1. Contract tests for all API endpoints
2. Integration tests for Web3 interactions
3. E2E tests for critical user journeys
4. Performance tests for real-time updates

### Security Considerations
1. All user inputs sanitized
2. Rate limiting on all endpoints
3. CORS properly configured
4. Environment variables for secrets

## Compliance & Legal

### Regulatory Considerations
- Terms of service required
- Privacy policy for data collection
- Disclaimer for financial risks
- Geographic restrictions may apply

### Smart Contract Considerations
- Upgradeable proxy pattern for fixes
- Multi-sig for admin functions
- Time locks for critical changes

## Conclusion

All technical uncertainties have been resolved with pragmatic decisions that balance performance, security, and development velocity. The architecture supports the sophisticated trading terminal aesthetic while maintaining the flexibility needed for a decentralized narrative market.

## Next Steps

Phase 1 will focus on:
1. Defining the complete data model
2. Creating OpenAPI contracts for all endpoints
3. Setting up the project structure
4. Writing initial contract tests

The research indicates this project is technically feasible with the chosen stack and can meet the performance and scale requirements specified.
