# Feature Specification: Veritas Inversa (Aletheia) Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-sophisticated`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a sophisticated website for the Veritas Inversa brand (Aletheia platform) - a decentralized narrative market on Bittensor. The website should embody a minimalist, clinical, data-centric aesthetic similar to financial trading terminals. Features include: narrative marketplace dashboard, narrative foundry for creating NFTs, validator/miner interfaces, real-time metrics visualization, semantic landscape analysis tools, and staking/underwriting functionality. The brand positioning emphasizes strategic information markets over technical implementation."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a sophisticated capital provider (hedge fund, political campaign, corporate entity, or researcher) interested in narrative markets, I want to access a professional platform where I can underwrite, monitor, and manage strategic narratives through economic incentives, similar to how I would interact with a financial trading platform.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new narrative underwriter visits the platform, **When** they view the marketplace dashboard, **Then** they see a real-time overview of all active narratives with staking metrics, recent activity, and semantic clustering
2. **Given** an underwriter wants to create a new narrative demand signal, **When** they use the narrative foundry, **Then** they can mint a new Narrative-NFT with proper metadata and see its semantic position relative to existing narratives
3. **Given** a validator needs to monitor network health, **When** they access their dashboard, **Then** they see consensus alignment, reputation scores, and oracle operational costs
4. **Given** a miner wants to prioritize high-value tasks, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** they see a ranked list of heavily staked narratives with potential rewards
5. **Given** a user is analyzing narrative competition, **When** they use the semantic landscape tool, **Then** they can visualize narrative clusters and identify dilution risks
6. **Given** an underwriter has staked on a narrative, **When** they return to monitor it, **Then** they see time-series staking data, fulfillment activity, and successful dissemination proofs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple users attempt to mint semantically identical narratives?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during real-time metric updates?
- What occurs when a user attempts to stake more $NARR than they possess?
- How does the platform display narratives with zero stake?
- What happens when dissemination proofs fail verification?

## Notes

This specification captures the core functionality for a sophisticated decentralized narrative market platform. The platform reframes content generation as "narrative underwriting" and positions itself as a strategic tool for information markets rather than a simple content creation service.

Key areas requiring clarification before implementation:
- Real-time update frequencies and performance requirements
- User authentication and security model
- Specific thresholds for duplicate detection
- Expected scale and concurrent user load
- Uptime and reliability requirements

The platform's success depends on creating a professional, data-driven experience that appeals to sophisticated market participants while abstracting the underlying technical complexity of the Bittensor network.
